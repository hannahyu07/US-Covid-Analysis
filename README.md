## Overview

This repo features a reproduction of the Jennifer B. Nuzzo and Jorge R. Ledesma paper, [`Why Did the Best Prepared Country in the World Fare So Poorly during COVID?`](https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.37.4.3), containing `R` scripts and a final `pdf` [`report`](https://github.com/hannahyu07/US-Covid-Analysis/blob/main/outputs/paper/paper.pdf). This analysis delves deep into the role of politics and public perception in shaping pandemic outcomes, building on the paper's findings about the United States' challenges during COVID-19.
