## Political Polarization, Public Trust, and Healthcare Disparities: Unraveling COVID-19's Impact and Future Preparedness


## Overview

This repo features a reproduction of the Jennifer B. Nuzzo and Jorge R. Ledesma paper, [`Why Did the Best Prepared Country in the World Fare So Poorly during COVID?`](https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.37.4.3), containing `R` scripts and a final `pdf` [report](https://github.com/hannahyu07/US-Covid-Analysis/blob/main/outputs/paper/paper.pdf). This analysis delves deep into the role of factors such as local health system capacities, public health policies, socio-economic disparities, and political affiliations.

A replication using the Social Science Reproduction Platform was also produced: [link here](https://www.socialsciencereproduction.org/reproductions/c35e8e98-762d-4c00-a1a3-544ed0b2008d/index)
